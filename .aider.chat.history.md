Build a mini app called “Budget Quest” — a simple Daily Savings Adventure Game designed to help users build better financial habits.

🎯 Goal

Gamify daily budgeting and saving. Users complete small savings challenges to earn points, level up, and receive monthly reward NFTs.

📌 Core Features (Keep it simple)
1. Wallet Connection

Allow users to connect their crypto wallet.

Store basic user profile + progress.

2. Daily Savings Challenge

AI generates one daily challenge, e.g.:

“Spend ₱50 less today”

“Avoid buying sugary drinks”

“Log today’s expenses”

A simple button to mark challenge as completed.

3. Points + Levelling System

Completing challenges earns:

Good Habit Points

On-chain badges

Users level up their Financial Warrior avatar.

4. Progress Dashboard

Daily streak counter

Total points

Current level

Earned badges (simple icons)

5. Monthly Reward NFT

If the user completes challenges consistently, allow them to claim a Monthly Achievement NFT.

🎨 Professional Color Theme

Use a modern, trustworthy, finance-friendly palette:

Primary: #2563EB (Blue — trust & stability)

Secondary: #16A34A (Green — savings & progress)

Accent: #FACC15 (Gold — rewards)

Background: #F8FAFC (Clean, soft white)

Text: #0F172A (Dark navy)

Overall style: minimal, clean, professional, and mobile-friendly.

🧭 UX Requirements (User-Friendly + Functional)

Your design should ensure:

Simple, single-tap daily challenge interaction

Clear visual progress indicators

Smooth wallet connection flow

Easy navigation: Home, Challenges, Progress, Rewards

Compact UI that works on small mobile devices

Friendly micro-animations (optional but recommended)

Avoid clutter. Make everything focused on the daily habit loop.

📌 Output Requirements

Provide:

A complete UI & UX layout

The smart components needed

Suggested screens (Home, Daily Challenge, Progress, Reward Claim)

Logic flow for challenges, points, badges, and monthly rewards

Keep the entire mini app simple, efficient, and ready for deployment.

A stylized logo featuring a shield with a dollar sign and a compass overlay, symbolizing financial protection and navigation. The design uses a modern blue (#2563EB) and green (#16A34A) palette with subtle gold accents (#FACC15) to convey trust, progress, and rewards. The background is a clean white (#F8FAFC) to keep the logo crisp and professional.
