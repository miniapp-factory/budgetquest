Build a mini app called “Budget Quest” — a simple Daily Savings Adventure Game designed to help users build better financial habits.

🎯 Goal

Gamify daily budgeting and saving. Users complete small savings challenges to earn points, level up, and receive monthly reward NFTs.

📌 Core Features (Keep it simple)
1. Wallet Connection

Allow users to connect their crypto wallet.

Store basic user profile + progress.

2. Daily Savings Challenge

AI generates one daily challenge, e.g.:

“Spend ₱50 less today”

“Avoid buying sugary drinks”

“Log today’s expenses”

A simple button to mark challenge as completed.

3. Points + Levelling System

Completing challenges earns:

Good Habit Points

On-chain badges

Users level up their Financial Warrior avatar.

4. Progress Dashboard

Daily streak counter

Total points

Current level

Earned badges (simple icons)

5. Monthly Reward NFT

If the user completes challenges consistently, allow them to claim a Monthly Achievement NFT.

🎨 Professional Color Theme

Use a modern, trustworthy, finance-friendly palette:

Primary: #2563EB (Blue — trust & stability)

Secondary: #16A34A (Green — savings & progress)

Accent: #FACC15 (Gold — rewards)

Background: #F8FAFC (Clean, soft white)

Text: #0F172A (Dark navy)

Overall style: minimal, clean, professional, and mobile-friendly.

🧭 UX Requirements (User-Friendly + Functional)

Your design should ensure:

Simple, single-tap daily challenge interaction

Clear visual progress indicators

Smooth wallet connection flow

Easy navigation: Home, Challenges, Progress, Rewards

Compact UI that works on small mobile devices

Friendly micro-animations (optional but recommended)

Avoid clutter. Make everything focused on the daily habit loop.

📌 Output Requirements

Provide:

A complete UI & UX layout

The smart components needed

Suggested screens (Home, Daily Challenge, Progress, Reward Claim)

Logic flow for challenges, points, badges, and monthly rewards

Keep the entire mini app simple, efficient, and ready for deployment.

A stylized logo featuring a shield with a dollar sign and a compass overlay, symbolizing financial protection and navigation. The design uses a modern blue (#2563EB) and green (#16A34A) palette with subtle gold accents (#FACC15) to convey trust, progress, and rewards. The background is a clean white (#F8FAFC) to keep the logo crisp and professional.

When the game starts, the user receives a virtual daily budget (e.g., ₱500–₱1,000), and the app presents several real-life choices such as buying coffee, ordering fast food, taking public transportation instead of a taxi, or purchasing a non-essential item. The user must choose how to spend their money, and each decision earns points based on whether the choice reflects smart financial behavior. Good decisions—such as choosing public transportation, skipping unnecessary snacks, or preparing food at home—give Good Habit Points, while poor decisions either reward fewer points or impose small penalties. At the end of the daily scenario, the app generates a summary showing the user’s remaining budget, total points earned, and a short AI insight explaining the financial impact of their choices. The user can also connect their wallet to store progress, earn on-chain badges for consistently making good decisions, and level up their Financial Warrior avatar over time. Completing days and maintaining streaks increases a monthly progress bar, and once the bar is full, the user can claim a Monthly Achievement NFT that represents their improved financial discipline.

The mini app must include simple and essential features: a wallet connection flow, a daily budget scenario screen, three to five real-life spending choices per day, a point calculation system, a progress dashboard showing streaks and levels, and a rewards screen for badges and monthly NFTs. The rules of the game should be easy to understand: (1) the user gets a fixed budget each day, (2) the user must choose how to spend or save, (3) each choice instantly affects their points and remaining budget, (4) completing the daily scenario finalizes their score and streak, and (5) completing enough days unlocks rewards. Everything should be clean, functional, and optimized for mobile use.

Use a modern, professional color theme suitable for a financial wellness app: royal blue (#2563EB) for primary actions, green (#16A34A) for progress and success indicators, gold (#FACC15) for rewards and badges, soft white (#F8FAFC) for background, and dark navy (#0F172A) for text.

The overall experience should be simple, friendly, gamified, and educational—helping users make smarter financial choices through interactive daily scenarios rather than boring budgeting tools.
