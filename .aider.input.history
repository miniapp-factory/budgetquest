+
+“Avoid buying sugary drinks”
+
+“Log today’s expenses”
+
+A simple button to mark challenge as completed.
+
+3. Points + Levelling System

+
+🎨 Professional Color Theme
+

+
+Primary: #2563EB (Blue — trust & stability)
+

+
+Accent: #FACC15 (Gold — rewards)
+
+Background: #F8FAFC (Clean, soft white)
+
+Text: #0F172A (Dark navy)
+
+Overall style: minimal, clean, professional, and mobile-friendly.
+
+🧭 UX Requirements (User-Friendly + Functional)
+

+

+
+Clear visual progress indicators
+
+Smooth wallet connection flow
+
+Easy navigation: Home, Challenges, Progress, Rewards
+
+Compact UI that works on small mobile devices
+
+Friendly micro-animations (optional but recommended)
+
+Avoid clutter. Make everything focused on the daily habit loop.

+A complete UI & UX layout
+
+The smart components needed
+
+Suggested screens (Home, Daily Challenge, Progress, Reward Claim)
+
+Logic flow for challenges, points, badges, and monthly rewards
