+
+“Avoid buying sugary drinks”
+
+“Log today’s expenses”
+
+A simple button to mark challenge as completed.
+
+3. Points + Levelling System

+
+Accent: #FACC15 (Gold — rewards)
+
+Background: #F8FAFC (Clean, soft white)

+Build a mini app called “Budget Quest”, a simple but meaningful financial decision-making game designed to help users develop better spending habits through real-life scenarios. When the game starts, the user receives a virtual daily budget (e.g., ₱500–₱1,000), and the app presents several real-life choices such as buying coffee, ordering fast food, taking public transportation instead of a taxi, or purchasing a non-essential item. The user must choose how to spend their money, and each decision earns points based on whether the choice reflects smart financial behavior. Good decisions—such as choosing public transportation, skipping unnecessary snacks, or preparing food at home—give Good Habit Points, while poor decisions either reward fewer points or impose small penalties. At the end of the daily scenario, the app generates a summary showing the user’s remaining budget, total points earned, and a short AI insight explaining the financial impact of their choices. The user can also connect their wallet to store progress, earn on-chain badges for consistently making good decisions, and level up their Financial Warrior avatar over time. Completing days and maintaining streaks increases a monthly progress bar, and once the bar is full, the user can claim a Monthly Achievement NFT that represents their improved financial discipline.
+
+The mini app must include simple and essential features: a wallet connection flow, a daily budget scenario screen, three to five real-life spending choices per day, a point calculation system, a progress dashboard showing streaks and levels, and a rewards screen for badges and monthly NFTs. The rules of the game should be easy to understand: (1) the user gets a fixed budget each day, (2) the user must choose how to spend or save, (3) each choice instantly affects their points and remaining budget, (4) completing the daily scenario finalizes their score and streak, and (5) completing enough days unlocks rewards. Everything should be clean, functional, and optimized for mobile use.
+
+Use a modern, professional color theme suitable for a financial wellness app: royal blue (#2563EB) for primary actions, green (#16A34A) for progress and success indicators, gold (#FACC15) for rewards and badges, soft white (#F8FAFC) for background, and dark navy (#0F172A) for text.
+
+The overall experience should be simple, friendly, gamified, and educational—helping users make smarter financial choices through interactive daily scenarios rather than boring budgeting tools.

+Dont create a landing page. Create the game directly. This is the details. 
+Create a mini app called “Budget Quest”, a simple financial decision-making game where the player learns smart budgeting through daily real-life spending scenarios. The game begins by giving the user a fixed daily starting money (e.g., ₱500–₱1,000). Each day, the app presents 3–5 real-life spending situations, such as choosing between buying coffee or drinking water, cooking at home versus eating fast food, taking a jeepney versus booking a taxi, buying a new shirt on impulse versus saving the money, or subscribing to a promo instead of regular load. The user must select one option per scenario. Each choice changes the user’s remaining money and earns or deducts points based on the financial wisdom of the decision. Smart, budget-friendly decisions earn Good Habit Points; unnecessary or impulsive choices give fewer points or small penalties.
+
+At the end of the daily sequence, the app summarizes the user’s remaining balance, total points earned, and a short AI-generated explanation of how their decisions reflect real-life financial habits. Users earn streak bonuses for completing consecutive days. Reaching certain point thresholds lets players level up their Financial Warrior, while consistent good decisions reward on-chain badges. Completing all daily challenges for a full month unlocks a Monthly Achievement NFT representing the user’s financial discipline.
+
+The rules of the game are simple: (1) The user starts each day with a fixed budget; (2) The game shows realistic financial choices; (3) The user selects one option per scenario; (4) Each option adjusts the remaining money and points; (5) The user finishes the day when all choices are made; (6) Scores, streaks, and levels are updated automatically; and (7) Monthly consistency rewards NFTs. The UI should focus purely on the game: budget display, scenario cards with choices, points earned, streak tracker, and end-of-day summary. Keep the gameplay loop quick, educational, and repeatable.
